# React Quiz Project

![image](public/Screenshot%202023-02-28%20153702.jpg)

This is a Quiz Project using React and [Opentdb](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) Api. This project is to test myself after finishing a course by [NetNinja]((https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja)), which is a good introduction to React.

## How to play

The quiz is pretty simple: click the start button, and React will get 10 questions from the API. If your answer is correct, the button will display "Correct", and "Wrong" if you choose the wrong answer, and display the correct answer.

## Stucture of the project

I used 3 file **App.js**  **QuizBrain.js**  **QAs,js** and **QuizContext.js**.

### **App.js**

 This file contains the main Header and icon links and Quizbrain component from Quizbrain.js

### **QuizBrain.js**

This file does most of the work: getting the data from the API, checking if the user entered the right answer, and rendering the result after finishing the questions.

### **QAs.js**

This file contains the individual parts or components of the project, like the questionBox which renders the question, boolean or multiple choice components.

I hope you enjoyðŸ¤© this small project.
